**Explanation of Changes:**
The only change made to the JDL is the addition of the `specialNeeds` field to the `Appointment` entity. This field is of type `TextBlob` which allows for longer text input, suitable for describing specific needs.
All other aspects of the user story (email notifications, cancellation logic, preventing overlapping appointments, admin approval workflow, UI design, etc.) are outside the scope of the JDL and will be implemented in the application code itself.  The JDL defines the data model, not the business logic or user interface.  Therefore, no other changes to the JDL are required based on the updated user story.
